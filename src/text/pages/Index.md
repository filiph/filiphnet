I've written a lot of articles over the years. Some of them are over at [selfimproving.dev](https://selfimproving.dev/), others [on Medium](https://medium.com/@filiph). Most of those are of a particular theme (software development and Flutter & Dart, respectively), and will stay where they are.

But for a long time, I wanted a place of my own on which to publish my articles. Not really a "blog", as it's really just static pages generated from Markdown files. But something close to that.

Articles:
