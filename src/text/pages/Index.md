I've written a lot of articles over the years. Some of them are over at [selfimproving.dev](https://selfimproving.dev/), others [on Medium](https://medium.com/@filiph). Most of those are of a particular theme (software development and Flutter & Dart, respectively), and will stay where they are.

But for a long time, I wanted a place of my own on which to publish my articles. Not really a "blog", as it's really just static pages generated from Markdown files. But something close to that.

Articles:

- [Welcome to the superstar economy](https://filiph.net/text/welcome-to-the-superstar-economy.html)  
  It’s when “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage” (Sherwin Rosen, 1981).
- [Respectfully, socialism is a bad idea](https://filiph.net/text/respectfully,-socialism-is-a-bad-idea.html)  
  I grew up in actual socialism, behind the Iron Curtain, and I find it a little bit worrying to see all these cool people promoting socialism these days.
- [We need technology that is less immersive, not more](https://filiph.net/text/we-need-technology-that-is-less-immersive,-not-more.html)  
  How come so many of the most talented engineers of our time work on making our entertainment more immersive?
- [(Personally) sustainable social media](https://filiph.net/text/(personally)-sustainable-social-media.html)  
  How does one use social media without falling into its traps?
- [The engineering principles behind GIANT ROBOT GAME](https://filiph.net/text/the-engineering-principles-behind-giant-robot-game.html)  
  How this weird game is being built.
- [Memex is already here, it's just not evenly distributed](memex-is-already-here,-it's-just-not-evenly-distributed.html)  
  How to keep an external brain using ideas from 1945 and technology from 2023.
- [Videogames that teach you stuff](videogames-that-teach-you-stuff.html)  
  Videogames like SimCity or Dwarf Fortress aren’t exactly “educational”, but they still teach you a lot.

Hope you enjoy at least some of them.
