In 2009, one Rosaire Appel published a book full of nonsensical schematics called _Math minus math_. Wikipedia lists it as an example of asemic writing — that is to say, writing without semantic content. But, while I occasionally enjoy applying juicy new words to stuff, in this case I'm happy to just call it an art book.

Just look at it:

All the images here are excerpts, never a full page. The book is short and self-published, and I don't want the author to lose any sales because of me.

If you're following my fascination with FUI (Futuristic, or Fictional, User Interfaces), you may understand why I'm in love with this.

I know these schematics and graphical pieces are not user interfaces. But I find that the FUI that I'm into tends to be very close, visually, to what Appel has put in this book.

I tend to apologize for my game's graphics because they do look basic. But since about a year ago, I've started hearing people say "no, I actually really like the graphics." And that's coming even from people whose [artistic style I adore](https://amanita-design.net/). So I guess there are people who _get it_, or who suffer from the same kind of deviancy as I do.

The book _Math minus math_ is not for everyone. It's graphical poetry — but I'd say even among people who'd normally buy graphic design books, the majority would consider it pointless and stupid.

Well, I — for one — am really glad it exists. I'm a bit sad I only learned about it now (even though I've been into this stuff for _at least_ 9 years at this point) but better late than never.

If you know about other obscure stuff like this (books, artists, demoscene projects), please _please_ let me know.
