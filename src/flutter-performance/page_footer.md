[Filip](https://filiph.net/) worked at Google for 14 years &mdash; the last 6 on the Dart and Flutter teams in Mountain View. You may recognize him from some of the educational content from that time. Now he’s based in Prague as an open-source contractor and game developer. He writes Dart code every day.

The text you just read is supposed to be a chapter in Filip’s planned [book about Dart and Flutter performance](/flutter-performance/).
[Get notified](/await) when he’s finished.

His main project these days is
[GIANT ROBOT GAME](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2538440/GIANT_ROBOT_GAME/)
